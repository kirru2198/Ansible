# 📁 Ansible Role: MySQL Deployment

This document walks through creating a proper **Ansible role structure** for MySQL using a single command, and explains what each part is used for.

---

## 📌 Goal

Create a role structure for **MySQL** under a project folder called `mysql-deploy` using one command, and then create the respective `main.yml` files under each subdirectory as per Ansible standards.

---

## 🏗️ Directory Structure

We want to create the following structure:

```
mysql-deploy/
└── roles/
    └── mysql/
        ├── tasks/
        │   └── main.yml
        ├── handlers/
        │   └── main.yml
        ├── vars/
        │   └── main.yml
        ├── defaults/
        │   └── main.yml
```

---

## 🔧 Create Directory Structure (Single Command)

Use this command to create the full structure in one go:

```bash
mkdir -p mysql-deploy/roles/mysql/{tasks,handlers,vars,defaults}
```

This avoids using multiple `mkdir` and `cd` commands. It efficiently creates all parent and child directories.

---

## 📂 Navigate and View the Tree

Use the `tree` command (install if not available):

```bash
sudo apt install tree
tree mysql-deploy/
```

This displays the full directory structure in a visual format, which is very helpful for understanding the role layout.

---

## 📄 Create `main.yml` Files

Each subdirectory inside a role has a purpose. Let's create the required `main.yml` files:

---

### 1. 🧾 `tasks/main.yml`

Navigate:

```bash
cd mysql-deploy/roles/mysql/tasks
```

Create the file:

```bash
vi main.yml
```

Add the following content (basic MySQL tasks):

```yaml
---
# Tasks for installing and configuring MySQL
- name: Install MySQL
  apt:
    name: mysql-server
    state: present

- name: Ensure MySQL service is started
  service:
    name: mysql
    state: started
    enabled: true

- name: Set MySQL root password
  mysql_user:
    name: root
    password: "{{ mysql_root_password }}"
    login_unix_socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

- name: Create sample database
  mysql_db:
    name: sample_db
    state: present
```

---

### 2. 🔁 `handlers/main.yml`

Navigate:

```bash
cd ../handlers
```

Create the file:

```bash
vi main.yml
```

Add this content:

```yaml
---
# Handler for restarting MySQL service
- name: restart mysql
  service:
    name: mysql
    state: restarted
```

---

### 3. 🔐 `vars/main.yml`

Navigate:

```bash
cd ../vars
```

Create the file:

```bash
vi main.yml
```

Add this content:

```yaml
---
# Variables used in the role
mysql_root_password: "redhat"
```

---

### 4. ⚙️ `defaults/main.yml`

Navigate:

```bash
cd ../defaults
```

Create the file:

```bash
vi main.yml
```

Add this content (optional defaults):

```yaml
---
# Default values for role
mysql_root_password: "redhat"
```

> Note: You can choose whether to put the password in `vars` or `defaults` based on your override preference.

---

## ✅ Summary

- We created a complete Ansible role for MySQL using a single directory command.
- We used `tree` to visualize the directory layout.
- We created `main.yml` files for each relevant subdirectory.
- This structure helps in organizing reusable and scalable playbooks.
