# Introduction to Ansible Modules and Playbooks

Good morning everyone! I hope I am audible, and you can see my screen. Can somebody please confirm? Thank you, VHE.

Alright, let's get started. I'll quickly log into my machine and dive into Ansible. If anyone has any questions or doubts, feel free to ask, and I'll repeat the concept if needed. 

## Key Concepts in Ansible

Today, we will focus on two essential concepts:

1. **Ansible Modules**
2. **Ansible Playbooks**

### Ansible Modules

**Ansible modules** are pre-written programs, typically written in Python. They are used to perform specific tasks, and you can find a wide range of modules in the [Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html).

Modules can be used for tasks such as configuration management, system administration, or automation of cloud services. Ansible modules are executed on remote machines and do the "hard work" of executing tasks as specified in the playbook.

#### Examples of Modules:

- **Network Modules**: These modules are used for network-related configurations. For example, if you need to automate network tasks like configuring routers or switches, you can use network-specific modules.
  
- **Cloud Modules**: Ansible supports cloud environments, including Ali Cloud, AWS, and Azure. Each cloud provider has specific modules for tasks such as managing instances, virtual machines, load balancers, and VPCs (Virtual Private Cloud).

- **Docker Modules**: If you're working with Docker, Ansible has modules to automate tasks like managing containers, images, and networks.

You can explore these modules by going to the official Ansible documentation and searching for categories such as **cloud**, **network**, **system**, etc. For example:

- **Cloud Modules**: You’ll find modules for managing AWS EC2, Ali Cloud, and Azure resources.
  
- **System Modules**: These modules are used for system-level tasks like managing files, packages, or firewalls. For example, there are modules for managing firewall rules or installing packages on a system.

#### Can You Write Your Own Modules?

Yes, if you have custom requirements, you can write your own modules in Python and use them in your playbooks. Additionally, you can contribute your custom modules back to the Ansible community to help others.

#### Best Practices

When using Ansible modules:

1. **Read Documentation**: Always refer to the official Ansible documentation to understand how a specific module works, its parameters, and how it should be used.
  
2. **Use Specific Modules for Specific Tasks**: Each module is designed for a specific task or service, so make sure to use the correct module for your task.

3. **Modular Approach**: Try to keep your playbooks modular by using appropriate modules to separate different tasks or roles.

### Ansible Playbooks

Now that we understand modules, let’s talk about **Ansible Playbooks**. Playbooks are used to define the automation tasks that you want to execute using Ansible. They are YAML-based files that describe the configuration, deployment, and orchestration of systems.

I will cover playbooks in more detail, but the essential point is that playbooks orchestrate the execution of various modules on one or more remote systems.

### Summary

1. **Modules**: Pre-written Python programs that handle specific tasks like network configuration, cloud automation, system administration, and Docker container management.

2. **Playbooks**: YAML-based files that define and orchestrate the automation tasks, calling modules to execute specific configurations on remote systems.

### Final Thoughts

- Always read the documentation for modules, especially when working with cloud providers, networking, or any specialized technology.
  
- If you're faced with a custom requirement, you can write your own modules in Python.

Let’s now move on to the lab exercises, where we’ll get hands-on experience with these concepts. If you have any questions during the session, please don't hesitate to ask!
