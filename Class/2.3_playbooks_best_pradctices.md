# ✅ Best Practices for Writing Ansible Playbooks

---

## 🎯 Why Follow Best Practices?

Following best practices helps in:

- Keeping playbooks **organized**
- Making playbooks **reusable**
- Easier to **maintain and debug**
- Supporting **team collaboration**

## 🔑 When to Use Single vs Multiple Playbooks

| Situation | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Small Infrastructure / Quick Tasks | ✅ Use a **single playbook** |
| Medium to Large / Complex Infrastructure | ✅ Use **multiple playbooks**, grouped by service/module |

> Similar to how we structure Terraform with separate files for variables, providers, and resources — we should structure Ansible the same way.

---

## 📁 Project Directory Structure

A good directory structure helps in organizing playbooks and related files.

### Example Structure:
```
my-ansible-project/
├── inventory/
│   └── hosts.ini
├── playbooks/
│   └── site.yml
├── roles/
│   ├── webserver/
│   └── database/
├── group_vars/
│   └── all.yml
└── ansible.cfg
```

## 📝 Inventory Files

### 🔹 Default Inventory File
- Located at: `/etc/ansible/hosts`
- Not recommended to modify for projects

```bash
cat /etc/ansible/hosts
```

### 🔹 Project-Specific Inventory
- Create your own for each project
- Example usage:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini playbooks/site.yml
```

> ✅ Creating your own inventory file avoids disturbing the global/default configuration.

## 💡 Notes on Default Inventory File

- Some OS (like **Amazon Linux**) may not have the default `/etc/ansible/hosts` file.
- That’s **normal** – you’re expected to create your own inventory file.

## 🧱 Best Practice Checklist

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | Create a separate **project folder** |
| 2️⃣ | Use **project-specific inventory** files |
| 3️⃣ | Group tasks into separate **playbooks** |
| 4️⃣ | Use **roles** to organize tasks (explained next) |
| 5️⃣ | Keep variables in **group_vars/ or host_vars/** |
| 6️⃣ | Don't modify the **default inventory file** |

## 📦 Coming Up: What are Roles?

> Next, we’ll explore **Ansible Roles** – a powerful way to break down playbooks into reusable components (like in object-oriented programming).
