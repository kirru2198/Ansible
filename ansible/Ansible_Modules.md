# Ansible Installation and Module Concept

## Checking if Ansible is Installed

To determine if Ansible is installed on your system and to view its version, you can use the following command:

```bash
ansible --version
```

This will output something similar to:

```
ansible [core 2.17.7]
config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
configured module search path = ['/home/kumar/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansible
ansible collection location = /home/kumar/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
python version = 3.12.3 (main, Sep 11 2024, 14:17:37) [GCC 13.2.0] (/usr/bin/python3)
jinja version = 3.1.2
libyaml = True
```

This confirms that Ansible is installed on your machine and provides important details like:

- **Ansible version**
- **Configuration file location** (`/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`)
- **Module search path** (where Ansible looks for its modules)
- **Location of Python modules and collections**
- **Python version** being used

## Ansible Modules: Understanding How Ansible Works

### What Are Ansible Modules?

In Ansible, modules are pre-written programs that perform specific tasks. These tasks are written in Python and can be used to automate various configurations and actions on remote servers (known as "slaves" in the context of Ansible). These modules are crucial to Ansible’s ability to manage servers without needing agents on the target machines.

### Where Are These Modules Stored?

When Ansible is installed, modules are placed in a specific location on your system. For example, on a Linux machine, you can find these modules in the following directory:

```bash
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansible/modules
```

To inspect this location, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansible/modules
```

Then list the files:

```bash
ls
```

You will see many `.py` (Python) files. These are the actual modules that Ansible uses to perform various tasks.

### Example of a Module

For instance, a file like `user.py` is responsible for managing users on remote machines. If you open the `user.py` file, you will see that it's a large Python script that performs various operations, such as creating, modifying, or deleting users on remote systems.

```bash
cat user.py
```

You'll notice that it's a Python program designed to manage users and perform tasks such as:

- Creating new users
- Modifying user attributes
- Deleting users

### How Do Ansible Modules Work?

Ansible modules are executed by the Ansible control machine (the "master") and are then copied to the target machine (the "slave") where they are executed. Here's how the process works:

1. **Module Download**: When you want to perform a specific task on a remote server, Ansible selects the appropriate module (e.g., `user.py` for user management).
   
2. **Module Transfer**: The module is copied (not moved) from the control machine (master) to the target machine (slave) over SSH. Ansible uses SCP or a similar method to copy the module.

3. **Module Execution**: Once the module is on the target machine, it is executed. For example, if you're managing users, the `user.py` module will handle the creation or modification of users.

4. **Task Completion**: After the task is completed, the module is deleted from the target machine. The control machine retains a copy of the module in its own directory.

5. **No Agent Required**: Since Ansible doesn’t require any agents on the remote servers (just SSH access), it makes use of these modules to perform actions remotely without having to install any specific software or agent on the target machine.

### Why Python and SSH are Required

- **Python**: Ansible modules are written in Python, so Python must be installed on both the control machine and the target machines. Without Python, the modules cannot execute.
- **SSH**: SSH is used to securely transfer the modules to the target machines and execute them. This is why SSH access is essential.

### Example: Managing Users with Ansible Modules

Let’s say you want to create a new user on multiple remote servers using Ansible. The process works as follows:

1. **Choose the Module**: Ansible will use the `user.py` module to manage users.
   
2. **Copy the Module**: The `user.py` module will be copied from the master to the slave machines.

3. **Execute the Task**: The module will create the user on the target machine.

4. **Delete the Module**: After the user creation task is complete, the module is automatically deleted from the target machine.

### Key Takeaways

- **Modules are pre-written Python scripts** that perform specific tasks on remote systems.
- **Ansible doesn’t require agents** on remote machines because it uses SSH and Python to execute tasks.
- **Modules are copied** from the control machine to the target machine, executed, and then deleted once the task is completed.
- **Python and SSH** are essential because the modules are written in Python and transferred via SSH.

## Conclusion

This workflow is the foundation of how Ansible operates. By using pre-written modules, Ansible allows system administrators to automate tasks across multiple machines without needing to install additional software on the target machines. It’s efficient, lightweight, and powerful, which is why it’s widely used for configuration management and automation tasks.
