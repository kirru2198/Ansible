Here's the typical directory structure for an Ansible project, showing where various files and directories are placed:

```plaintext
ansible_project/
│
├── ansible.cfg                # Configuration file for Ansible settings
├── inventory/                 # Directory containing the inventory files
│   └── hosts                  # Hosts inventory file (lists remote systems)
├── playbooks/                 # Directory containing Ansible playbooks
│   └── main.yml               # Main Ansible playbook
├── roles/                     # Directory containing roles (for modular task management)
│   └── example_role/          # A specific role
│       ├── tasks/             # Directory for tasks within the role
│       │   └── main.yml       # Main task file for the role
│       ├── templates/         # Templates for configuration files
│       └── files/             # Files to be copied to the remote machines
├── group_vars/                # Group-specific variables
│   └── all.yml                # Variables applied to all hosts
└── host_vars/                 # Host-specific variables
    └── host1.yml              # Variables for a specific host
```

### Explanation of Key Directories and Files:

- **ansible.cfg**: This is the Ansible configuration file where global settings (e.g., inventory location, verbosity) are defined.
- **inventory/**: Contains files that define the hosts and groups of hosts for Ansible to manage.
  - `hosts`: This is the inventory file where the host IP addresses or names and groupings are defined.
- **playbooks/**: Contains the playbooks, which are YAML files with automation instructions. For example, `main.yml` could be the primary playbook that runs all the tasks.
- **roles/**: Used to organize playbooks into reusable components, each with its own tasks, templates, and files. A role can be thought of as a module for automation.
  - `tasks/`: Contains task files that define the actions to be executed on hosts.
  - `templates/`: Stores Jinja2 templates for configuration files that can be applied to the target hosts.
  - `files/`: Stores files that can be copied to the remote hosts.
- **group_vars/**: Contains YAML files with variables that apply to specific groups of hosts defined in the inventory.
  - `all.yml`: Variables that are shared across all groups of hosts.
- **host_vars/**: Contains YAML files with variables specific to individual hosts.

This directory structure helps in organizing and managing Ansible configurations and playbooks in a scalable and modular way.
