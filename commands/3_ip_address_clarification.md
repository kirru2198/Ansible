In this case, the `<slave-ip-address>` should be replaced with the **private IP address** of the slave machine.

This is because, when you're setting up Ansible (or similar tools) for managing nodes within a local network or cloud infrastructure, you typically use private IP addresses to connect between the master and slave nodes. 

Hereâ€™s the example configuration:

```ini
[servers]
server1 ansible_host=<slave-private-ip-address>
```

If the master node and the slave node are within the same local network or VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), then you would use the **private IP address** of the slave. Using private IPs helps with direct communication within the network, and it's more efficient than going over the public internet.

However, if you need to manage a remote slave node over the public internet, you would use the **public IP address**. In such a case, you may also need to ensure that the firewall allows the necessary traffic and the slave node is configured to accept SSH connections over the internet.
