installing Ansible on AWS
Pre-requisites:
Step 1: Ensure Python is installed on both the machines i.e., Master and Slave.

By default AWS Ubuntu images have Python installed. You can skip this step if
you are setting up Ansible on AWS. On other machines, install Python using the
following command:
       sudo apt-get install python3

Step 2: Enable keyless SSH access between Ansible Master and Slave. To
accomplish this, do the following:
        On Master, pass the following command:
              $ ssh-keygen
    After this, keep the default values and keep on pressing enter till you reach the
following screen:

Step 3: Once done print id_rsa.pub file using the command:
      sudo cat ./.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Step 4: Copy the output of this file and paste it in the slave machine’s authorized_keys file. You can do that using the following command. Once inside the file, paste the output.
        $ sudo nano ./.ssh/authorized_keys
    Insert the new entry in the second line of the file. Save and exit.

Keyless access has now been configured between your Ansible master and slave. You can verify by doing a SSH from your master to your slave and you should be freely able to do so.

      With this, you have now successfully configured the pre-requisites.

Installing Ansible on Master:
Step 1: Pass the following commands to install Ansible on the Master:
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt install ansible 

Step 2: Next, configure the slave by creating the hosts file in the Master. To edit the file, pass the following command:
$ sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts

Once inside, enter the following syntax to add a slave. In this syntax, servers is the group and server1 is the slave machine’s name. You can give any name of your choice.

[servers]
server1 ansible_host=<slave-ip-address>
There will be some sample entries. You can ignore them and add the new values. With this, your ansible configuration is complete.

Step 3: Finally, you can test the Ansible Master-Slave connection by passing the following command:
$ ansible -m ping all

If everything is configured correctly, you will get the above output.
