Enable keyless SSH access between Ansible Master and Slave:

To enable keyless SSH access between your Ansible master (control node) and slave (managed node), you need to configure SSH key-based authentication. This allows you to run Ansible commands without needing to input a password each time. Here's how you can do it step by step:

Step 1: Generate an SSH Key Pair on the Ansible Master (Control Node)
  1. Open a terminal on your Ansible master (the control node).
  2. Generate an SSH key pair by running:
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
        This will prompt you to choose the location to save the key. Press Enter to accept the default path (~/.ssh/id_rsa).
        You can choose to enter a passphrase or leave it empty (for keyless login, leave it empty).
        This will generate two files:
          Private key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
          Public key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Step 2: Copy the Public Key to the Managed Node (Slave)
  1. Copy the public key from the Ansible master to the slave node using ssh-copy-id or manually.
      Using ssh-copy-id:
        Run the following command from the control node:
            ssh-copy-id user@slave_ip
              Replace user with the appropriate username on the slave machine and slave_ip with the slave node's IP address.
              You will be prompted for the password of the remote user. Enter it once, and ssh-copy-id will copy your public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to the slave machine’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.

    Alternatively, manually copy the key:
      If ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the key:
        1. On the Ansible master, display the content of your public key:
              cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        2. On the slave node, create the .ssh directory if it doesn't already exist:
              mkdir -p ~/.ssh
        3. Paste the contents of the public key from the Ansible master into a file named authorized_keys on the slave node:
              echo "your-public-key" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
                  Make sure the permissions are set correctly:
                      chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
                      chmod 700 ~/.ssh

Step 3: Verify SSH Access from the Master to the Slave
    1. From the Ansible master, try to SSH into the slave without a password:
        ssh user@slave_ip
            You should be able to log in without being asked for a password.

Step 4: Configure Ansible to Use SSH
    1. On the Ansible master, make sure that the ansible_ssh_private_key_file option is set in your Ansible inventory file or in your playbook if you're using a custom private key. By default, Ansible uses the SSH key stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa, but if you have a custom key, you can specify it.
      Example in inventory.ini:
          [web]
          slave_ip ansible_ssh_user=user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa

      Example in a playbook:
          ---
          - name: Ensure keyless SSH works
            hosts: web
            tasks:
              - name: Ping the node
                ping:


Step 5: Test the Connection from Ansible Master to Slave
    1. Test Ansible by running a simple ping module command to check connectivity:
        ansible web -m ping
          Replace web with the appropriate group or host name from your inventory file.
          If everything is configured correctly, you should see a response like this:
              slave_ip | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
              pong

Additional Tips:
  If you're using a non-standard SSH key or a custom location for the key, ensure that the key is properly referenced in your Ansible configuration or inventory.
  If the managed node is behind a firewall, ensure that port 22 (SSH) is open for incoming connections.
  You can also use ansible.cfg to set global SSH options if needed, like specifying the private key location:
      [defaults]
      private_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_rsa

That’s it! You've successfully enabled keyless SSH access between the Ansible master and slave. Now, you can run your Ansible commands without having to manually input a password each time.
