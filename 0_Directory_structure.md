Sure! Here's the directory structure for organizing Ansible playbooks with roles, based on the example you've provided:

### Directory Structure

```bash
MySQL_deploy/                      # Parent project directory
├── roles/                         # Directory for all reusable roles
│   └── mysql/                     # MySQL specific role
│       ├── defaults/              # Default values for variables
│       │   └── main.yml           # Default variables (e.g., MySQL root password)
│       ├── files/                 # Static files (e.g., MySQL configuration files)
│       ├── handlers/              # Handlers to notify certain actions (e.g., restart MySQL)
│       │   └── main.yml           # Handlers for tasks like restarting MySQL
│       ├── tasks/                 # Tasks to be executed
│       │   └── main.yml           # Tasks for installing MySQL and setting configurations
│       ├── templates/             # Templates (e.g., Jinja2 templates)
│       ├── vars/                  # Variables specific to the role
│       │   └── main.yml           # Custom variables (e.g., MySQL root password)
│       └── meta/                  # Role dependencies and metadata (optional)
├── deploy_mysql.yml              # Main playbook to deploy MySQL using the MySQL role
├── inventory/                    # Inventory file (list of hosts/servers)
│   └── hosts.ini                 # Example inventory file specifying the target servers
└── ansible.cfg                   # Ansible configuration file (optional)
```

### Description of Directories and Files:

1. **roles/**: This is the main folder where we define reusable roles for specific tasks.
   - **mysql/**: A directory for the MySQL role, which includes all tasks and configurations for installing and managing MySQL.

2. **defaults/**: Contains default variable values for the role. For example, the default MySQL root password, which can be overridden by other variables.

3. **files/**: Static files that need to be copied to the target machines. These can include configuration files or scripts required by the role.

4. **handlers/**: Special tasks that are triggered by other tasks (e.g., restarting MySQL after a configuration change).

5. **tasks/**: The main tasks that Ansible will execute. This could include installing MySQL, configuring it, and starting the service.

6. **templates/**: Template files, typically written in Jinja2, which allow for dynamic configuration files with variable substitutions.

7. **vars/**: Variables that are specific to the role, like the MySQL root password or other system-specific configurations.

8. **meta/**: This directory can include role dependencies or metadata (optional for basic roles).

9. **deploy_mysql.yml**: The playbook that calls the MySQL role and specifies the target machine(s) for deployment.

10. **inventory/hosts.ini**: Inventory file listing all the target servers or groups of servers that the playbook will run against.

11. **ansible.cfg**: Optional configuration file that specifies settings for how Ansible behaves (e.g., default inventory file, user settings).

This structure helps in maintaining modularity and reusability of your playbooks, making it easier to manage and scale infrastructure automation projects.
