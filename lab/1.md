### ✅ **Task Summary**
1. **Setup Ansible Cluster** with 3 nodes (1 master, 2 slaves)
2. **Install Java** on **slave1**
3. **Install MySQL Server** on **slave2**

---

### 🧾 **Assumptions**
- You have SSH access from the master to both slave nodes.
- You’ve already installed Ansible on the master node.
- Your inventory file (`/etc/ansible/hosts`) is properly configured.

---

### 🛠 Step-by-Step Setup

---

#### 🗂️ Step 1: Inventory File (`/etc/ansible/hosts`)

```ini
[master]
master ansible_host=192.168.56.10 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa

[slave1]
slave1 ansible_host=192.168.56.11 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa

[slave2]
slave2 ansible_host=192.168.56.12 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

---

#### 📁 Step 2: Create Ansible Playbook File `setup.yml`

```yaml
---
- name: Install Java on Slave 1
  hosts: slave1
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update APT repo
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install default JDK
      apt:
        name: default-jdk
        state: present

- name: Install MySQL Server on Slave 2
  hosts: slave2
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update APT repo
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install MySQL Server
      apt:
        name: mysql-server
        state: present

    - name: Start MySQL Service
      service:
        name: mysql
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

---

#### ▶️ Step 3: Run the Playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook setup.yml
```

---

### ✅ Final Checklist

- ✔️ Java will be installed on `slave1`.
- ✔️ MySQL server will be installed and started on `slave2`.
- ✔️ The playbook uses `become: yes` to elevate privileges.
- ✔️ Uses APT module for package management on Ubuntu/Debian systems.

---

to check Java is installed on slave1 use the following command on slave1:

```bash
java --version
```

to check MySQL is installed on slave2 use the following command on slave2:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql
```
