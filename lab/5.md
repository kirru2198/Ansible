 Tasks To Be Performed:
 1. Create a new deployment of Ansible cluster of 5 nodes
 2. Label 2 nodes as test and other 2 as prod
 3. Install Java on test nodes
 4. Install MySQL server on prod nodes
 Use Ansible roles for the above and group the hosts under test and prod.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to create an **Ansible-based solution** for managing a 5-node cluster where you:

1. Label 2 nodes as `test`, 2 as `prod`.
2. Install **Java** on `test` nodes.
3. Install **MySQL** server on `prod` nodes.
4. Use **Ansible roles** to keep tasks modular and reusable.

### ✅ Step 1: Setup Your Ansible Inventory

Create an **inventory file** to define your cluster nodes and group them into `test` and `prod`.

**`inventory.ini`**
```ini
[test]
test-node1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
test-node2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102

[prod]
prod-node1 ansible_host=192.168.1.103
prod-node2 ansible_host=192.168.1.104

[all:vars]
ansible_user=your_user
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

> ⚠️ Replace `your_user` and IPs with real values.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Create Your Ansible Project Structure

```bash
mkdir ansible-cluster-setup && cd ansible-cluster-setup

# Initialize a roles directory
ansible-galaxy init roles/java
ansible-galaxy init roles/mysql

# Create a playbook
touch site.yml
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Define Java Installation Role

**`roles/java/tasks/main.yml`**
```yaml
---
- name: Update apt cache
  apt:
    update_cache: yes
  become: yes

- name: Install OpenJDK 17
  apt:
    name: openjdk-17-jdk
    state: present
  become: yes
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Define MySQL Installation Role

**`roles/mysql/tasks/main.yml`**
```yaml
---
- name: Install MySQL server
  apt:
    name: mysql-server
    state: present
  become: yes
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Create the Main Playbook

**`site.yml`**
```yaml
---
- name: Apply Java role to test nodes
  hosts: test
  roles:
    - java

- name: Apply MySQL role to prod nodes
  hosts: prod
  roles:
    - mysql
```

---

### ✅ Step 6: Run the Playbook

Make sure Ansible is installed and then run:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini site.yml
```

---

### ✅ Optional: Add Host Labels as Tags or Facts

If needed, you can label the hosts within Ansible using custom facts:

**`roles/java/tasks/main.yml`** (additional task)
```yaml
- name: Set test label
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    node_label: "test"
```

**`roles/mysql/tasks/main.yml`** (additional task)
```yaml
- name: Set prod label
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    node_label: "prod"
```

### Summary of What You Did:

| Task | Done |
|------|------|
| Created inventory | ✅ |
| Grouped nodes into `test` and `prod` | ✅ |
| Used roles to modularize tasks | ✅ |
| Installed Java on test nodes | ✅ |
| Installed MySQL on prod nodes | ✅ |

---

to check Java is installed on slave1 use the following command on slave1:

```bash
java --version
```

to check MySQL is installed on slave2 use the following command on slave2:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql
```
