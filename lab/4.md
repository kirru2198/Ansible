 Tasks To Be Performed:
 1. Use the previous deployment of Ansible cluster
 2. Configure the files folder in the role with index.html which should be replaced with the original index.html
 
 All of the above should only happen on the slave which has NGINX installed using the role
---

## ✅ Assumptions

- You've already deployed your Ansible cluster with `slave1` (Apache) and `slave2` (NGINX).
- You already have the `nginx` role structure in place under `roles/nginx`.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Add a Custom `index.html` to the Role

Create the `files/` folder under your NGINX role (if it doesn’t exist):

```bash
mkdir -p roles/nginx/files
```

Create a custom `index.html` file:

```bash
echo "<h1>This is a custom NGINX index page served by Ansible</h1>" > roles/nginx/files/index.html
```

---

## ✅ Step 2: Update `roles/nginx/tasks/main.yml`

Append this task **after the NGINX installation task** in `roles/nginx/tasks/main.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Install NGINX
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    update_cache: yes

- name: Replace default NGINX index.html with custom one
  copy:
    src: index.html
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html
    owner: www-data
    group: www-data
    mode: '0644'
```

> This task copies the `index.html` from `roles/nginx/files/index.html` to the NGINX default web root directory.

---

## ✅ Step 3: (Optional) Ensure NGINX Is Restarted or Running

You can optionally add this task to make sure NGINX is started:

```yaml
- name: Ensure NGINX is running
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: true
```

---

## ✅ Step 4: Re-run Your Playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini site.yml
```

---

## ✅ Step 5: Verify

SSH into `slave2` or use Ansible to verify:

```bash
curl http://172.31.12.74
```

You should see:
```
This is a custom NGINX index page served by Ansible
```
