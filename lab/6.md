 Problem Statement:
You are a DevOps Engineer and the organization you are working on needs to  set up two configuration management server groups. One for Apache, another  for NGINX. Being a DevOps Engineer it is your task to deal with this 
 configuration management issue.
 
Let us see the tasks that you need to perform using Ansible:
 1. Create two server groups. One for Apache and another for NGINX
 2. Push two html files with their server information
 
Make sure that you donâ€™t forget to start the services once the installation is done.  Also send post installation messages for both the server groups. 
 
Using Ansible roles accomplish the above tasks. Also, once the Apache server  configuration is done you need to install Java on that server group using Ansible  role in a Playbook.
