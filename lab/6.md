 Problem Statement:
You are a DevOps Engineer and the organization you are working on needs to  set up two configuration management server groups. One for Apache, another  for NGINX. Being a DevOps Engineer it is your task to deal with this 
 configuration management issue.
 
Let us see the tasks that you need to perform using Ansible:
 1. Create two server groups. One for Apache and another for NGINX
 2. Push two html files with their server information
 
Make sure that you don’t forget to start the services once the installation is done.  Also send post installation messages for both the server groups. 
 
Using Ansible roles accomplish the above tasks. Also, once the Apache server  configuration is done you need to install Java on that server group using Ansible  role in a Playbook.

Here’s a **step-by-step solution** using **Ansible roles** to handle the configuration management for Apache and NGINX servers, push HTML files, start services, and install Java on Apache servers after configuration.

## **Step-by-Step Ansible Solution**

### **1. Directory Structure (Best Practice for Roles)**

Use the following folder structure:

```
ansible-setup/
├── inventory/
│   └── hosts.ini
├── playbooks/
│   ├── site.yml
│   ├── apache.yml
│   ├── nginx.yml
│   └── java_install.yml
├── roles/
│   ├── apache/
│   │   ├── tasks/
│   │   └── files/
│   ├── nginx/
│   │   ├── tasks/
│   │   └── files/
│   └── java/
│       └── tasks/
```

---

### **2. Inventory File (`inventory/hosts.ini`)**

```ini
[apache]
apache1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10

[nginx]
nginx1 ansible_host=192.168.1.11
```

Replace IPs with real server IPs.

---

### **3. HTML Files (`roles/apache/files/index.html` and `roles/nginx/files/index.html`)**

- **`roles/apache/files/index.html`**:
```html
<html><body><h1>Apache Server - apache1</h1></body></html>
```

- **`roles/nginx/files/index.html`**:
```html
<html><body><h1>NGINX Server - nginx1</h1></body></html>
```

---

### **4. Role: Apache (`roles/apache/tasks/main.yml`)**

```yaml
---
- name: Install Apache
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present
    update_cache: yes

- name: Copy HTML file
  copy:
    src: index.html
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html

- name: Start Apache
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
    enabled: yes

- name: Post-install message
  debug:
    msg: "Apache installation and configuration completed!"
```

---

### **5. Role: NGINX (`roles/nginx/tasks/main.yml`)**

```yaml
---
- name: Install NGINX
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    update_cache: yes

- name: Copy HTML file
  copy:
    src: index.html
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html

- name: Start NGINX
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes

- name: Post-install message
  debug:
    msg: "NGINX installation and configuration completed!"
```

---

### **6. Role: Java (`roles/java/tasks/main.yml`)**

```yaml
---
- name: Install Java
  apt:
    name: default-jdk
    state: present
    update_cache: yes

- name: Confirm Java installation
  debug:
    msg: "Java has been successfully installed on Apache server."
```

---

### **7. Playbook to Run All Tasks (`playbooks/site.yml`)**

```yaml
---
- import_playbook: apache.yml
- import_playbook: java_install.yml
- import_playbook: nginx.yml
```

---

### **8. Apache Playbook (`playbooks/apache.yml`)**

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Apache Server
  hosts: apache
  become: yes
  roles:
    - apache
```

---

### **9. Java Install Playbook (`playbooks/java_install.yml`)**

```yaml
---
- name: Install Java on Apache servers
  hosts: apache
  become: yes
  roles:
    - java
```

---

### **10. NGINX Playbook (`playbooks/nginx.yml`)**

```yaml
---
- name: Configure NGINX Server
  hosts: nginx
  become: yes
  roles:
    - nginx
```

---

### **11. Run the Playbook**

From the root of the project:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini playbooks/site.yml
```
