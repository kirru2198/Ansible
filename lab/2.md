 Tasks To Be Performed:
 1. Create a script which can add text “This text has been added by custom script” to /tmp.1.txt
 2. Run this script using Ansible on all the hosts

---

## ✅ **Objective**
1. Create a custom script that adds the text:  
   `"This text has been added by custom script"` to `/tmp/1.txt`.
2. Use Ansible to run this script on **all hosts** in your inventory.

---

## ✅ **Step 1: Create the Bash Script**

Create a file called `add_text.sh` in your project directory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "This text has been added by custom script" > /tmp/1.txt
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x add_text.sh
```

---

## ✅ **Step 2: Inventory File (`hosts.ini`)**

Make sure your `hosts.ini` lists all the hosts where you want to run the script:

```ini
[all]
master ansible_host=192.168.56.10 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
slave1 ansible_host=192.168.56.11 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
slave2 ansible_host=192.168.56.12 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa

[all:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
```

---

## ✅ **Step 3: Ansible Configuration File (`ansible.cfg`)**

```ini
[defaults]
inventory = hosts.ini
host_key_checking = False
retry_files_enabled = False
```

---

## ✅ **Step 4: Ansible Playbook (`run_custom_script.yml`)**

Now create an Ansible playbook that will copy the script to all hosts and execute it:

```yaml
---
- name: Run custom script on all hosts
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Copy custom script to remote host
      copy:
        src: add_text.sh
        dest: /tmp/add_text.sh
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Execute the script
      command: /tmp/add_text.sh
```

---

## ✅ **Step 5: Run the Playbook**

Now, execute the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook run_custom_script.yml
```

---

## ✅ **Step 6 (Optional): Verify the Result**

You can verify it by running:

```bash
ansible all -a "cat /tmp/1.txt"
```
